## An Open, Crowdsourced Repository of APIs

Thingpedia is the open repository of API used by the [Almond Virtual Assistant](https://almond.stanford.edu).
Anyone can contribute the interface code to access any device or web service, and publish it on Thingpedia.

This package contains a command line tool to interact with Thingpedia.
The tool helps with creating new devices, packing them for publication,
and using the Thingpedia APIs.

Thingpedia and Almond are research projects led by prof. Monica Lam,
from Stanford University.  You can find more information at
